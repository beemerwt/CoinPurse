# Coin Purse
Get those pesky valuables out of your inventory!

## Features
- All coins are stored as a number. No more stacks of coins cluttering your inventory.
- Valuable items like ruby, amber, amber pearl, and silver necklace all get converted to coins upon looting.
- Usable at vendors to buy items.
- No configuration. Just plug and play!

## Installation
The easiest way to install is to use the provided mod manager on Thunderstore.

### Manual Installation
Download the zip file and extract the CoinPurse folder into your BepInEx plugins folder.

This mod also requires Jotunn which [can be installed here](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ValheimModding/Jotunn/)

## Warning
When first entering a world using this mod all coins and valuable items in your inventory will be converted into your coin purse. Although I have tested this extensively in my own worlds, I strongly suggest making a backup just in case something goes wrong.
